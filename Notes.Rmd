# Getting started

## Running the app

* While running the Shiny app, the console displays "Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5919" - this URL can be copied into any compatible web browser  
* You can reload the app after making changes while its running using `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`  

## Adding behaviour

* render{Type} is often matched with {type}Output 
* To avoid repeating lines of code, usually either use a variable or a function - in Shiny you use reactive expressions
* Reactive expressions involve wrapping a chunk of code and sotring it in a variable, and calling it like a function - it will only run the first time it is called and then caches the result
